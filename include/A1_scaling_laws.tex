\section{Scaling laws of the NGS model}
\label{sec:appendix_scaling_laws}

While the full radial dependence in the NGS model has to be calculated numerically as described in \cref{ssec:isotropic_model}, the normalization constants, i.e. the quantities at the sonic radius only weakly depend on the energy at the boundary condition $E_\text{bc}$, as shown in \cref{fig:ode0_scan,fig:prefactors_0th_order}.
Scaling laws for all dimensionless quantities of importance are provided here for convenience, in the form
\begin{equation}
    f(E_\text{bc}) = a_0 + a_1 \cdot \log_{10}E_\text{bc} \, .
\end{equation}
The coefficients $a_0(\gamma)$ and $a_1(\gamma)$ are provided in \cref{tab:scaling_law_coefficients}.
Especially important for the pellet rocket force is $p_\star$ (\cref{eq:prefactor_p_star}) and the corresponding prefactor $f_p$.
Note that we have found two small mistakes in the corresponding equations given by \textcite{parks_effect_1978}. 
For $v_\star$, they missed a factor of $\sqrt{T_{e0}}$ and for $p_\star$ they missed a factor of $\sim 10^{-12}$.

While $\lambda_\star$, $r_\text{p}$, $E_\infty$ and $q_\infty$ are the direct results of the numerical procedure described in \cref{ssec:isotropic_model}, the normalized quantities $f_p$, $f_T$, $f_v$ and $f_G$ are the dimensionless prefactors for $p_\star$, $T_\star$, $v_\star$ and $G$ in \cref{eq:prefactor_p_star,eq:prefactor_T_star,eq:prefactor_v_star,eq:prefactor_G}.}

The perturbative pressure asymmetry $p_1(r_\text{p})$ is found to depend linearly on the heat source asymmetry parameter $E_\text{rel}/q_\text{rel}$ in \cref{ssec:asymmetric_perturbation_model}.
Linear regression in the form 
\begin{equation}
    p_1(r_\text{p}) = a \cdot \left(\frac{E_\text{rel}}{q_\text{rel}} - b \right)
\end{equation}
is performed on the numerical results.
However, the parameters $a$ and $b$ depend on the parameters $\gamma$ and $E_\text{bc}$, as shown in \cref{fig:P1_fit_parameters}.
Here, we provide scaling laws for these parameters in the form
\begin{gather}
    a = a_0 + a_1 \log_{10} E_\text{bc} \, \\
    b = b_0 + b_1 (\log_{10} E_\text{bc})^{b_2} \, .
\end{gather}
The corresponding coefficients are listed in \cref{tab:p1_fit_scaling_laws}.
