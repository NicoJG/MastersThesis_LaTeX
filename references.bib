Abstract:
Fusion power is a proposed form of power generation that would use the heat from nuclear fusion reactions to generate electricity. The leading candidate for a practical fusion reactor is a device called a tokamak, a device which uses a powerful magnetic field to confine plasma in the shape of a torus. {ITER} (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) is a large international program that will bring together 35 countries to construct the world's largest tokamak in the south of France. Effective and reliable disruption (plasma instabilities) mitigation is critical for {ITER} and future tokamak reactors to avoid dam- ages due to extreme localized heating, deposition of high-energy relativistic electrons, and large electromechanical forces. The U.S. is the lead international partner in the development of a Disruption Mitigation System ({DMS}) for {ITER}. The most likely candidate for this {DMS} is the shattered pellet injection ({SPI}) which consists of injecting a plume of neon-deuterium fragments into the plasma thus bringing about a thermal quench. A 3D numerical model for the ablation of pellets and {SPI} fragments in tokamaks in the plasma disruption mitigation and fueling parameter space has been developed based on the Lagrangian particle method. The Lagrangian Particle pellet code implements the low magnetic Reynolds number {MHD} equations, kinetic models for the electronic heating, a pellet surface ablation model, an equation of state that supports multiple ionization states, radiation, and a model for grad-B drift of the ablated material across the magnetic eld. 3D simulations were performed to predict processes in the ablation cloud, the cloud shielding length, and pellet ablation rates. They also address the sensitivity of the pellet ablation processes to the various physics models, in particular the {MHD} forces and grad-B drift. These results are in good agreement with theory for spherically symmetric ablation ows and axisymmetric simulations of neon and deuterium pellets in increasing magnetic elds using the {FronTier} code. Finally, a detailed study of the influence of 3D effects, in particular grad-B drift, on pellet ablation rates and properties of ablation clouds is presented.},

The motion has been attributed to a vertical curvature and ∇B drift current induced inside the ionized ablated material by the 1/R toroidal field variation. The uncompensated vertical drift current inside the weakly diamagnetic (β\&lt;0.1) ablation cloud will cause charge separation at the boundary. The resulting electrostatic field induces the E×B drift to the large-R side of the torus. The calculated fuel penetration depth is consistent with inside launched pellet experiments on the {DIII}-D tokamak [J. L. Luxon and L. G. Davis, Fusion Technol. 8, 441 (1985)]. The dependence of the penetration depth with plasma parameters suggests that low velocity inside launched pellets may provide a unique solution to the refueling problem in larger and hotter machines of the future.},

The pellet ablation and deposition profiles are simulated for neutral-beam injection heated plasmas and are shown to reproduce well the main characteristics of the observed drift displacement for both low-field side and high-field side ({HFS}) injected pellets. The model describes the parallel expansion of ionized ablated pellet particle cloudlets (plasmoid) in non-axisymmetric magnetic configurations and the associated evolution of the plasmoid drift acceleration force exerted by the average magnetic field gradient over the plasmoid length. It is shown that, during the ablation and early homogenization phases, plasmoids are strongly accelerated towards the inverse direction of the local magnetic field gradient. In the case of the {LHD}, its direction and magnitude depend mainly on the pellet launching location with respect to the external helical coils. While such an initial drift—induced near the ablation region—is efficiently damped by plasmoid internal currents as soon as the plasmoid length becomes comparable to a toroidal connection length, a weak drift acceleration force is maintained over the whole homogenization time, whose direction depends on whether the confining magnetic field possesses a magnetic well or hill structure. Simulations show that, in a strong magnetic hill configuration like the {LHD}, this small but long-term drift becomes significant and results in a radially outward displacement of the mass deposition even for pellets injected from the {HFS}.},

            Understanding pellet ablation physics is crucial to realizing efficient fueling into a high temperature plasma for the steady state operation of {ITER} and future fusion reactors. Here we report the first observation of the formation of fluctuation structures in the pellet plasmoid during the pellet ablation process by a fast camera in a medium-sized fusion device, Heliotron J. The fluctuation has a normalized fluctuation level of {\textasciitilde} 15\% and propagates around the moving pellet across the magnetic field. By comparing the fluctuation structures with the shape of magnetic field lines calculated with the field line tracing code, we successfully reconstruct the spatio-temporal structure of the fluctuations during the pellet ablation process. The fluctuations are located at the locations displaced toroidally from the pellet and propagate in the cross-field direction around the pellet axis along the field line, indicating a three-dimensional behavior and structure of fluctuations. The fluctuation would be driven by a strong inhomogeneity formed around the pellet and invoke the relaxation of the gradient through a cross-field transport induced by the fluctuations, which could affect the pellet ablation and pellet fueling processes. Such fluctuations can be ubiquitously present at the inhomogeneity formed around a pellet in the pellet ablation process in fusion devices.},

The key finding is that the centrifugal force of cloud rotation pushes the cloud density radially outwards, creating a more “transparent” ablation channel. With reduced shielding, the steady state ablation rate of a deuterium pellet significantly increases from ∼35\% to 100\%, depending on the B-field strength. This new effect brings the ablation rate into better accord with a known theoretical scaling law, which agrees with most current experiments.},

	abstract = {Enhanced confinement is observed in neutral beam injector ({NBI})-heated hydrogen discharges made in the stellarator {TJ}-{II} after the injection of a single cryogenic fuel pellet into the plasma core. In addition to the expected increase in electron density, ne, in the core after pellet injection ({PI}), the plasma diamagnetic energy content is seen to rise, with respect to similar discharges without {PI}, by up to 40\%. Furthermore, the energy confinement time, τEdiag, as determined using a diamagnetic loop, is enhanced when compared to predictions obtained using the International Stellarator Scaling law [H. Yamada et al., Nucl. Fusion 45, 1684 (2005)] and the triple product, ne · Ti · τEdiag, exhibits a clear bifurcation point toward an improved confinement branch as compared to the branch product predicted by this scaling law. In general, once such a pellet-induced enhanced confinement ({PiEC}) phase has been established, it is characterized by steepened radial density gradients, by more negative plasma potential in the core, more negative radial electric fields, Er, across a broad plasma region, as well as by reductions in density and plasma potential fluctuations in the density gradient region. In addition, experimental observations show increased peaking of core radiation losses, this pointing to edge/core plasma decoupling. In parallel, neoclassical simulations of reference and {PiEC} plasmas predict increased particle and energy confinement times during a {PiEC} phase together with a more negative Er profile. Qualitative rather than quantitative agreement with experimental parameters is found, indicating that turbulence seems to play a significant role here. In summary, single cryogenic pellet injection facilitates the achievement of an enhanced operational regime that was previously not observed in {NBI}-heated discharges of the {TJ}-{II}.},

Conspectus: 
Currently, cryogenic pellet injection is the leading core fueling technique, since it allows deeper fuel penetrations than conventional gas puffing and does not introduce an energy source in the plasma core. Despite this, some involved mechanisms, particularly for stellarators, remain unclear. For instance, pellet deflections have been observed in both stellarators and tokamaks and several models have been developed to explain this process. In tokamaks, a radial acceleration is usually observed, but predictions tend to overestimate the experimental observations. In contrast, in stellarators the situation is more complex, since pellets are also deflected in the vertical direction. In this work, pellet acceleration experiments are carried out in on-axis electron cyclotron resonance heated hydrogen plasmas in the {TJ}-{II} stellarator. The three-dimensional pellet trajectory and the different components of the pellet acceleration, assumed to be constant, are studied using the {TJ}-{II} double-bundle fast camera system. This allows estimating the dependency of the different components of the pellet acceleration on the plasma current, electron density and temperature, as well as pellet mass and injection velocity. In addition to the above, experimental results are compared with predictions from the stellarator version of the {HPI}2 code, including pellet acceleration. This is done by using the 1st Principles and Semi-empirical models in {HPI}2, recently extended to stellarators.

pellet as a result of the elevated pellet surface temperature The ablated molecules
flow away from the surface of the pellet and simultaneously attenuate the incoming
plasma electron energy flux due to elastic and inelastic collisions The resulting
thermal energy source provided to the flow controls the velocity of the flow just
over the pellets' surface and provides a subtle connection between the pellet surface
conditions and this gas-dynamic expansion of the ''ablation cloud'' A set of scaling
laws is derived from the analysis in the asymptotic limit of high density plasmas

	abstract = {The sudden loss of confinement of the energy content of fusion plasmas in off-normal events, called disruptions, is among the most severe threats to the future of fusion energy based on the tokamak design. An efficient disruption mitigation system will therefore be of utmost importance for future large, high-current devices such as {ITER}. The potentially greatest threat to be mitigated is posed by currents carried by highly energetic electrons, called runaway electrons, which may cause severe damage upon wall impact. The disruption mitigation system must also ensure a sufficiently homogeneous deposition of the thermal energy on the plasma-facing components, and avoid excessive forces on the machine due to currents flowing in the surrounding structures. The currently envisaged mitigation method is to initiate a massive material injection, e.g. in the form of a pressurized gas or a shattered cryogenic pellet, when an emerging disruption is detected, and so attempt to better control the plasma cooling and energy dissipation. {\textless}br /{\textgreater}{\textless}br /{\textgreater}In this thesis, we develop modeling tools for the various physical phenomena present during a tokamak disruption mitigated by a massive material injection. This includes extending the numerical tools {GO} and {DREAM} with the capability to handle more advanced geometry, effects of partial ionization in the cooling plasma on the generation of runaway electrons, and the material assimilation in the plasma following a shattered pellet injection. These tools are then used to perform integrated numerical simulations, assessing the mitigation performance for a wide range of injection scenarios in reactor-scale tokamak devices. Finally, we also develop an analytical model for the radial transport of the relatively cold and dense material recently ablated from a shattered pellet upon exposure to the hot plasma.{\textless}br /{\textgreater}{\textless}br /{\textgreater}Our results indicate that the severity of a disruption in a reactor-scale device can be significantly reduced by a carefully chosen injection scheme and composition of the injected material. In particular, a two-stage shattered pellet injection might efficiently reduce the localised heat loads and the runaway generation due to the hot-tail mechanism, by allowing for an intermediate equilibration of the superthermal electron population between the injections. {\textless}br /{\textgreater}However, the strong runaway avalanche associated with a high plasma current was found to be able to amplify even a very small runaway seed, such as those produced by tritium decay and Compton scattering during nuclear operation, to several mega-amperes. The reason is that the intense cooling from the injected material leads to a high induced electric field and a substantial recombination, resulting in an enhanced avalanche multiplication. Our calculations also indicate that this mitigation scheme might be further complicated by a relatively large outward drift of the recently ablated pellet material.},

	abstract = {Application of two-point stereoscopic diagnostics using a fast camera and bundled fibre has enabled the observation of the three-dimensional nature of the pellet trajectory in the Large Helical Device. It has been observed that the pellet trajectory deviates from its injection direction, toroidally and vertically depending on the direction of the tangentially applied neutral beams. The magnitude of the toroidal deviation is similar in the clockwise as well as counter-clockwise neutral beam directions and is of 15–20 cm with a deflection speed of up to 400 m s−1. In contrast, an asymmetry in trajectory deflection has been observed in the vertical direction. Experimental results also indicate that the starting radius of the pellet trajectory bending in the counter-clockwise neutral beam case is more inward to that of the plasma. Collectively this leads to less penetration of the pellet inside the plasma and is prominent in the case of the clockwise neutral beam. Additionally, this fact supports evidence that the fast ion plays an important role in the pellet ablation process in the Large Helical Device. The pellet deflection is explained by the rocket effect due to unilateral ablation by the fast ions. The possible cause of the difference in the vertical deflection is explained by considering the geometrical aspects of the magnetic field structure.},

Spectroscopic measurements of the emitted light allowed the density and temperature of the ablation cloud, and for the first time also of the drifting plasmoids, to be determined. The experiments give a new insight into the dynamics of the formation of striations during the pellet ablation; these striations cause the separation of the ablated material into a sequence of separated, drifting plasmoids. The influence of the drift on the mass deposition profile for high field side pellet injection is discussed. The plasmoid dynamics even influences the radial pellet motion, most probably owing to a rocket effect.

The physics fidelity is considerably increased compared to previous studies, by e.g., using realistic magnetic geometry, resistive wall configuration, thermal quench onset criteria, as well as including additional effects, such as ion transport and enhanced runaway electron transport during the thermal quench. The work aims to provide a fairly comprehensive coverage of experimentally feasible scenarios, considering plasmas representative of both non-activated and high-performance {DT} operation, different thermal quench onset criteria and transport levels, a wide range of hydrogen and neon quantities injected in one or two stages, and pellets with various characteristic shard sizes. Using a staggered injection scheme, with a pure hydrogen injection preceding a mixed hydrogen-neon injection, we find injection parameters leading to acceptable runaway electron currents in all investigated discharges without activated runaway sources. Dividing the injection into two stages is found to significantly enhance the assimilation and minimize runaway electron generation due to the hot-tail mechanism. However, while a staggered injection outperforms a single stage injection also in cases with radioactive runaway electron sources, no cases with acceptable runaway electron currents are found for a {DT}-plasma with a 15 {MA} plasma current.},

	abstract = {It is shown that the ablation of a solid hydrogen pellet subject to a plasma is likely to produce a quasi-steady dense neutral gas cloud. The total integrated density of the cloud is such that the plasma electrons lose essentially all their energy in the cloud. The electron energy flux is degraded by inelastic collisions and elastic backscattering with the neutral molecules, providing local heating and acceleration of the neutral gas. Only a small fraction of the energy flux reaches the surface of the pellet, raising the pellet's surface temperature to a point where the energy flux at the pellet's surface is in balance with the energy lost through vaporization. The vaporization rate, in turn, determines the total integrated neutral gas cloud density. The scaling laws derived from the model indicate that the pellet lifetime varies as: where τp is the lifetime of the pellet and Te, ne, and rp0 are the electron temperature, density of the plasma, and initial pellet radius, respectively. A good agreement is found between this model and the {ORMAK} pellet injection experiment.},

	abstract = {Pellet injection is an effective tool for modifying the density profile in fusion devices, and can be used for both fuelling and plasma control. It has been employed successfully to mitigate transient events in tokamaks, e.g. disruptions. The use of pellets to control such events is also planned for {ITER}. In order to assess the performance of pellet injection schemes for future fusion devices, such as {ITER}, it is important that accurate estimates of the modified density profile created by the pellets are included in the modelling tools used to simulate such events. This can only be achieved through an understanding of the underlying physics of the mass deposition after pellet injection. Estimating the material deposition profile of a pellet is strongly affected by the pellet's trajectory and changing velocity. When a pellet is injected into a hot, magnetically confined plasma, it travels through the plasma in solid form while the outer layers are continuously ablated by the energy flux from the hot background plasma, resulting in material being deposited along the pellet trajectory. The cloud of ablated material initially has a cold dense structure-a plasmoid-which drifts towards the low-field side of the torus. This is caused by the charge separation that takes place due to electron and ion drifts in the inhomogeneous magnetic field, leading to the build-up of a vertical electric field, and the resulting E × B-drift moves the ablated material across magnetic field lines, where E and B denote the electric and magnetic field, respectively. This drift creates asymmetry and non-uniform heating of the ablation cloud. The asymmetry results in a less efficient shielding on the pellet's high field side region, where the enhanced ablation pushes the pellet towards the low field side, like a rocket. The rocket effect may strongly influence trajectories and penetration of pellets in fusion plasmas. Rocket model The aim of this project is to develop a semi-analytical model to study this effect and estimate pellet rocket acceleration in fusion devices. The rocket effect is driven by the difference in the cloud pressure on the low field side and high field side of the pellet. Simpler estimates to explain existing observations in medium-sized tokamaks exist, see e.g. [1, 2], but they are not widely used in the community. Only recently it has become apparent that this effect can be significant in future tokamaks with higher temperatures. The questions we would like to know the answer to are:  What is the order of magnitude of the acceleration from the rocket effect?  How does that depend on the pellet size, composition and background plasma parameters?  Is this effect in agreement with the observed acceleration in existing tokamaks (within reasonable margins)?  Is this effect strong enough to influence disruption mitigation plans for {ITER}?  Can we derive a self-contained model for the rocket-acceleration that can be implemented in simulation tools?

	abstract = {The neutral gas shielding model and neutral-gas-plasma shielding model are analyzed qualitatively. The main physical processes that govern the formation of the shielding gas cloud and, consequently, the ablation rate are considered. For the neutral gas shielding model, simple formulas relating the ablation rate and cloud parameters to the parameters of the pellet and the background plasma are presented. The estimates of the efficiency of neutral gas shielding and plasma shielding are compared. It is shown that the main portion of the energy flux of the background electrons is released in the plasma cloud. Formulas for the ablation rate and plasma parameters are derived in the neutral-gas-plasma shielding model. The question is discussed as to why the neutral gas shielding model describes well the ablation rate of the pellet material, although it does not take into account the ionization effects and the effects associated with the interaction of ionized particles with the magnetic field. The reason is that the ablation rate depends weakly on the energy flux of hot electrons; as a result, the attenuation of this flux by the electrostatic shielding and plasma shielding has little effect on the ablation rate. This justifies the use of the neutral gas shielding model to estimate the ablation rate (to within a factor of about 2) over a wide range of parameters of the pellet and the background plasma. © 2005 Pleiades Publishing, Inc.},

The reason for pellet acceleration is believed to originate from drift effects: the ionised part of pellet cloud is affected by the grad-B drift, therefore, the cloud becomes polarised. The E × B drift then deforms the pellet cloud so that it can no longer follow the original flux bundle - this results in a less efficient shielding on the pellet's {HFS} region, where the subsequently enhanced ablation pushes the pellet towards {LFS}, like a rocket. In order to study this effect, a simple and a comprehensive ablation model was developed.
