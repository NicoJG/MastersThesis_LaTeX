	abstract = {An analytical model for the ablation dynamics of a solid hydrogen pellet in a plasma
was formulated The need for a new model became evident as a result of recent pellet
injection experiments which showed that pellets vaporized much faster than predicted
by existing theories In this model molecules are vaporized off the surface of the
pellet as a result of the elevated pellet surface temperature The ablated molecules
flow away from the surface of the pellet and simultaneously attenuate the incoming
plasma electron energy flux due to elastic and inelastic collisions The resulting
thermal energy source provided to the flow controls the velocity of the flow just
over the pellets' surface and provides a subtle connection between the pellet surface
conditions and this gas-dynamic expansion of the ''ablation cloud'' A set of scaling
laws is derived from the analysis in the asymptotic limit of high density plasmas
(n/sub eo/ approximately greater than 1013 cm-3) or large pellets (r/sub p, scales
as approximately greater than 01 cm) For example, it is discovered that the pellet
surface regression speed, r/sub p/, scales as r/sub p/ α n/sub eo//sup 1/3/-r/sub
p//sup -2/3/T/sub eo//sup 1/2/Λ//sup -2/3/ where Λ is an ''effective energy flux cross
section'' which is related to the plasma electron temperature as Λ approximately T/sub

	url = {https://research.chalmers.se/en/publication/535522},
	abstract = {The sudden loss of confinement of the energy content of fusion plasmas in off-normal events, called disruptions, is among the most severe threats to the future of fusion energy based on the tokamak design. An efficient disruption mitigation system will therefore be of utmost importance for future large, high-current devices such as {ITER}. The potentially greatest threat to be mitigated is posed by currents carried by highly energetic electrons, called runaway electrons, which may cause severe damage upon wall impact. The disruption mitigation system must also ensure a sufficiently homogeneous deposition of the thermal energy on the plasma-facing components, and avoid excessive forces on the machine due to currents flowing in the surrounding structures. The currently envisaged mitigation method is to initiate a massive material injection, e.g. in the form of a pressurized gas or a shattered cryogenic pellet, when an emerging disruption is detected, and so attempt to better control the plasma cooling and energy dissipation. {\textless}br /{\textgreater}{\textless}br /{\textgreater}In this thesis, we develop modeling tools for the various physical phenomena present during a tokamak disruption mitigated by a massive material injection. This includes extending the numerical tools {GO} and {DREAM} with the capability to handle more advanced geometry, effects of partial ionization in the cooling plasma on the generation of runaway electrons, and the material assimilation in the plasma following a shattered pellet injection. These tools are then used to perform integrated numerical simulations, assessing the mitigation performance for a wide range of injection scenarios in reactor-scale tokamak devices. Finally, we also develop an analytical model for the radial transport of the relatively cold and dense material recently ablated from a shattered pellet upon exposure to the hot plasma.{\textless}br /{\textgreater}{\textless}br /{\textgreater}Our results indicate that the severity of a disruption in a reactor-scale device can be significantly reduced by a carefully chosen injection scheme and composition of the injected material. In particular, a two-stage shattered pellet injection might efficiently reduce the localised heat loads and the runaway generation due to the hot-tail mechanism, by allowing for an intermediate equilibration of the superthermal electron population between the injections. {\textless}br /{\textgreater}However, the strong runaway avalanche associated with a high plasma current was found to be able to amplify even a very small runaway seed, such as those produced by tritium decay and Compton scattering during nuclear operation, to several mega-amperes. The reason is that the intense cooling from the injected material leads to a high induced electric field and a substantial recombination, resulting in an enhanced avalanche multiplication. Our calculations also indicate that this mitigation scheme might be further complicated by a relatively large outward drift of the recently ablated pellet material.},

It has been observed that the pellet trajectory deviates from its injection direction, toroidally and vertically depending on the direction of the tangentially applied neutral beams. The magnitude of the toroidal deviation is similar in the clockwise as well as counter-clockwise neutral beam directions and is of 15–20 cm with a deflection speed of up to 400 m s−1. In contrast, an asymmetry in trajectory deflection has been observed in the vertical direction. Experimental results also indicate that the starting radius of the pellet trajectory bending in the counter-clockwise neutral beam case is more inward to that of the plasma. Collectively this leads to less penetration of the pellet inside the plasma and is prominent in the case of the clockwise neutral beam. Additionally, this fact supports evidence that the fast ion plays an important role in the pellet ablation process in the Large Helical Device. The pellet deflection is explained by the rocket effect due to unilateral ablation by the fast ions. The possible cause of the difference in the vertical deflection is explained by considering the geometrical aspects of the magnetic field structure.},

Spectroscopic measurements of the emitted light allowed the density and temperature of the ablation cloud, and for the first time also of the drifting plasmoids, to be determined. The experiments give a new insight into the dynamics of the formation of striations during the pellet ablation; these striations cause the separation of the ablated material into a sequence of separated, drifting plasmoids. The influence of the drift on the mass deposition profile for high field side pellet injection is discussed. The plasmoid dynamics even influences the radial pellet motion, most probably owing to a rocket effect.

The physics fidelity is considerably increased compared to previous studies, by e.g., using realistic magnetic geometry, resistive wall configuration, thermal quench onset criteria, as well as including additional effects, such as ion transport and enhanced runaway electron transport during the thermal quench. The work aims to provide a fairly comprehensive coverage of experimentally feasible scenarios, considering plasmas representative of both non-activated and high-performance {DT} operation, different thermal quench onset criteria and transport levels, a wide range of hydrogen and neon quantities injected in one or two stages, and pellets with various characteristic shard sizes. Using a staggered injection scheme, with a pure hydrogen injection preceding a mixed hydrogen-neon injection, we find injection parameters leading to acceptable runaway electron currents in all investigated discharges without activated runaway sources. Dividing the injection into two stages is found to significantly enhance the assimilation and minimize runaway electron generation due to the hot-tail mechanism. However, while a staggered injection outperforms a single stage injection also in cases with radioactive runaway electron sources, no cases with acceptable runaway electron currents are found for a {DT}-plasma with a 15 {MA} plasma current.},

	abstract = {It is shown that the ablation of a solid hydrogen pellet subject to a plasma is likely to produce a quasi-steady dense neutral gas cloud. The total integrated density of the cloud is such that the plasma electrons lose essentially all their energy in the cloud. The electron energy flux is degraded by inelastic collisions and elastic backscattering with the neutral molecules, providing local heating and acceleration of the neutral gas. Only a small fraction of the energy flux reaches the surface of the pellet, raising the pellet's surface temperature to a point where the energy flux at the pellet's surface is in balance with the energy lost through vaporization. The vaporization rate, in turn, determines the total integrated neutral gas cloud density. The scaling laws derived from the model indicate that the pellet lifetime varies as: where τp is the lifetime of the pellet and Te, ne, and rp0 are the electron temperature, density of the plasma, and initial pellet radius, respectively. A good agreement is found between this model and the {ORMAK} pellet injection experiment.},

	abstract = {Pellet injection is an effective tool for modifying the density profile in fusion devices, and can be used for both fuelling and plasma control. It has been employed successfully to mitigate transient events in tokamaks, e.g. disruptions. The use of pellets to control such events is also planned for {ITER}. In order to assess the performance of pellet injection schemes for future fusion devices, such as {ITER}, it is important that accurate estimates of the modified density profile created by the pellets are included in the modelling tools used to simulate such events. This can only be achieved through an understanding of the underlying physics of the mass deposition after pellet injection. Estimating the material deposition profile of a pellet is strongly affected by the pellet's trajectory and changing velocity. When a pellet is injected into a hot, magnetically confined plasma, it travels through the plasma in solid form while the outer layers are continuously ablated by the energy flux from the hot background plasma, resulting in material being deposited along the pellet trajectory. The cloud of ablated material initially has a cold dense structure-a plasmoid-which drifts towards the low-field side of the torus. This is caused by the charge separation that takes place due to electron and ion drifts in the inhomogeneous magnetic field, leading to the build-up of a vertical electric field, and the resulting E × B-drift moves the ablated material across magnetic field lines, where E and B denote the electric and magnetic field, respectively. This drift creates asymmetry and non-uniform heating of the ablation cloud. The asymmetry results in a less efficient shielding on the pellet's high field side region, where the enhanced ablation pushes the pellet towards the low field side, like a rocket. The rocket effect may strongly influence trajectories and penetration of pellets in fusion plasmas. Rocket model The aim of this project is to develop a semi-analytical model to study this effect and estimate pellet rocket acceleration in fusion devices. The rocket effect is driven by the difference in the cloud pressure on the low field side and high field side of the pellet. Simpler estimates to explain existing observations in medium-sized tokamaks exist, see e.g. [1, 2], but they are not widely used in the community. Only recently it has become apparent that this effect can be significant in future tokamaks with higher temperatures. The questions we would like to know the answer to are:  What is the order of magnitude of the acceleration from the rocket effect?  How does that depend on the pellet size, composition and background plasma parameters?  Is this effect in agreement with the observed acceleration in existing tokamaks (within reasonable margins)?  Is this effect strong enough to influence disruption mitigation plans for {ITER}?  Can we derive a self-contained model for the rocket-acceleration that can be implemented in simulation tools?

The main physical processes that govern the formation of the shielding gas cloud and, consequently, the ablation rate are considered. For the neutral gas shielding model, simple formulas relating the ablation rate and cloud parameters to the parameters of the pellet and the background plasma are presented. The estimates of the efficiency of neutral gas shielding and plasma shielding are compared. It is shown that the main portion of the energy flux of the background electrons is released in the plasma cloud. Formulas for the ablation rate and plasma parameters are derived in the neutral-gas-plasma shielding model. The question is discussed as to why the neutral gas shielding model describes well the ablation rate of the pellet material, although it does not take into account the ionization effects and the effects associated with the interaction of ionized particles with the magnetic field. The reason is that the ablation rate depends weakly on the energy flux of hot electrons; as a result, the attenuation of this flux by the electrostatic shielding and plasma shielding has little effect on the ablation rate. This justifies the use of the neutral gas shielding model to estimate the ablation rate (to within a factor of about 2) over a wide range of parameters of the pellet and the background plasma. © 2005 Pleiades Publishing, Inc.},

The E × B drift then deforms the pellet cloud so that it can no longer follow the original flux bundle - this results in a less efficient shielding on the pellet's {HFS} region, where the subsequently enhanced ablation pushes the pellet towards {LFS}, like a rocket. In order to study this effect, a simple and a comprehensive ablation model was developed. Results from both models show quantitatively acceptable agreement with {ASDEX}-Upgrade experiments concerning trajectory curvature, corresponding to radial acceleration in the range of 104-107 m/s2. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A knowledge of solid hydrogen pellet lifetimes in a plasma is critical to the design of devices to refuel tokamak fusion reactors. When the pellet is injected into the plasma, the ablated material from the pellet undergoes a transonic flow since it is heated while it expands. Calculations are done on the behavior of the transonic flow for various plasma conditions and pellet sizes. From these calculations, the ablation rate and lifetimes of the pellet are determined. A scaling law is given which allows pellet lifetimes to be easily calculated for any plasma conditions. The results of these calculations give good agreement when compared with experiments.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Pellet injection is used for fuelling and controlling discharges in tokamaks, and it is foreseen in {ITER}. During pellet injection, a movement of the ablated material towards the low-field side (or outward major radius direction) occurs because of the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field. Due to the complexity of the theoretical models, computer codes developed to simulate the cross-field drift are computationally expensive. Here, we present a one-dimensional semi-analytical model for the radial displacement of ablated material after pellet injection, taking into account both the Alfvén and ohmic currents which shortcircuit the charge separation creating the drift. The model is suitable for rapid calculation of the radial drift displacement, and can be useful for e.g. modelling of disruption mitigation via pellet injection.},
