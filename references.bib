The mitigation of runaway electron beams is thus a key requirement for reliable operation of {ITER}. In order to achieve reliable disruption mitigation, a new fast shutdown technique has been developed: the injection of a large shattered cryogenic pellet in the plasma, which is expected to increase the electron density up to levels where the beam generation processes are mitigated by collisional losses. This technique has been implemented and tested for the first time ever on {DIII}-D. The first tests show evidence of an almost instantaneous deposition of more than 260 Pa m

              of deuterium deep in the core. Record local densities during the thermal quench were observed for each injection with a very high reliability.

              Pellet injection is the most promising technique to achieve efficient plasma core fuelling, key for attaining stationary scenarios in large magnetic confinement fusion devices. In this paper, the injection of pellets with different volumes and speeds into standard plasma scenarios in {ITER} (tokamak) and Wendelstein 7-X (stellarator) is studied by modeling the pellet ablation and particle deposition, focusing on the evaluation of the expected differences in pellet plasmoid drifts in tokamaks and stellarators. Since the efficiency of the damping-drift mechanisms is predicted to depend on the magnetic configuration, device-specific characteristics are expected for the temporal evolution of the plasmoid drift acceleration. For instance, plasmoid-internal Pfirsch–Schlüter currents dominate the drift damping process for stellarators, while plasmoid-external currents are more relevant for tokamaks. Also, relatively larger drifts are in principle expected for W7-X due to higher field gradients in relation to machine dimensions. However, shorter plasmoid-internal charge reconnection lengths result in the drift damping due to internal Pfirsch–Schlüter currents being more effective than in a tokamak. Therefore, the average relative drift displacement during the whole plasmoid homogenization may
              a priori
              be comparable in both magnetic configurations. Moreover, High Field Side ({HFS}) injection is expected to be highly advantageous to maximize pellet particle deposition in {ITER}, whereas it may only be beneficial in medium to high
              β
              environments in W7-X. Finally, there may be means for the optimization of pellet injection configurations in both {ITER} and W7-X for the considered plasma scenarios despite the sizeable differences in the relative importance of the mechanisms of plasmoid drift acceleration and deceleration in play.},

This diamagnetic plasmoid is accelerated to the magnetic low field side of the torus. The high β plasmoid drift was directly observed by an optical diagnostic with high space and time resolution. Spectroscopic measurements of the emitted light allowed the density and temperature of the ablation cloud, and for the first time also of the drifting plasmoids, to be determined. The experiments give a new insight into the dynamics of the formation of striations during the pellet ablation; these striations cause the separation of the ablated material into a sequence of separated, drifting plasmoids. The influence of the drift on the mass deposition profile for high field side pellet injection is discussed. The plasmoid dynamics even influences the radial pellet motion, most probably owing to a rocket effect. The physical principles of the high β plasmoid drift are discussed and compared with the experimental observations.},

The pellet ablation and deposition profiles are simulated for neutral-beam injection heated plasmas and are shown to reproduce well the main characteristics of the observed drift displacement for both low-field side and high-field side ({HFS}) injected pellets. The model describes the parallel expansion of ionized ablated pellet particle cloudlets (plasmoid) in non-axisymmetric magnetic configurations and the associated evolution of the plasmoid drift acceleration force exerted by the average magnetic field gradient over the plasmoid length. It is shown that, during the ablation and early homogenization phases, plasmoids are strongly accelerated towards the inverse direction of the local magnetic field gradient. In the case of the {LHD}, its direction and magnitude depend mainly on the pellet launching location with respect to the external helical coils. While such an initial drift—induced near the ablation region—is efficiently damped by plasmoid internal currents as soon as the plasmoid length becomes comparable to a toroidal connection length, a weak drift acceleration force is maintained over the whole homogenization time, whose direction depends on whether the confining magnetic field possesses a magnetic well or hill structure. Simulations show that, in a strong magnetic hill configuration like the {LHD}, this small but long-term drift becomes significant and results in a radially outward displacement of the mass deposition even for pellets injected from the {HFS}.},

Conspectus: 
Currently, cryogenic pellet injection is the leading core fueling technique, since it allows deeper fuel penetrations than conventional gas puffing and does not introduce an energy source in the plasma core. Despite this, some involved mechanisms, particularly for stellarators, remain unclear. For instance, pellet deflections have been observed in both stellarators and tokamaks and several models have been developed to explain this process. In tokamaks, a radial acceleration is usually observed, but predictions tend to overestimate the experimental observations. In contrast, in stellarators the situation is more complex, since pellets are also deflected in the vertical direction. In this work, pellet acceleration experiments are carried out in on-axis electron cyclotron resonance heated hydrogen plasmas in the {TJ}-{II} stellarator. The three-dimensional pellet trajectory and the different components of the pellet acceleration, assumed to be constant, are studied using the {TJ}-{II} double-bundle fast camera system. This allows estimating the dependency of the different components of the pellet acceleration on the plasma current, electron density and temperature, as well as pellet mass and injection velocity. In addition to the above, experimental results are compared with predictions from the stellarator version of the {HPI}2 code, including pellet acceleration. This is done by using the 1st Principles and Semi-empirical models in {HPI}2, recently extended to stellarators.

              {SPI} discharge considered. Impurities that pre-exist before the {SPI} as well as those from possible impurity influxes related to the {SPI} are shown to dominate the radiation in the considered discharge. With inputs from {JOREK} simulations, modelling with the Lagrangian particle-based pellet code {PELOTON} reproduces the deviation of the {SPI} fragments in the direction of the major radius as observed by the fast camera. This confirms the role of rocket effects and plasmoid drifts in the considered discharge and reinforces the validity of the {JOREK} modelling. The limited core density rise due to plasmoid drifts and the strong radiative cooling and {MHD} activity with impurities (depending on their species and concentration) could limit the effectiveness of {LFS}

	abstract = {This study systematically explores the parameter space of disruption mitigation through shattered pellet injection in {ITER} with a focus on runaway electron dynamics, using the disruption modelling tool {DREAM}. The physics fidelity is considerably increased compared to previous studies, by e.g., using realistic magnetic geometry, resistive wall configuration, thermal quench onset criteria, as well as including additional effects, such as ion transport and enhanced runaway electron transport during the thermal quench. The work aims to provide a fairly comprehensive coverage of experimentally feasible scenarios, considering plasmas representative of both non-activated and high-performance {DT} operation, different thermal quench onset criteria and transport levels, a wide range of hydrogen and neon quantities injected in one or two stages, and pellets with various characteristic shard sizes. Using a staggered injection scheme, with a pure hydrogen injection preceding a mixed hydrogen-neon injection, we find injection parameters leading to acceptable runaway electron currents in all investigated discharges without activated runaway sources. Dividing the injection into two stages is found to significantly enhance the assimilation and minimize runaway electron generation due to the hot-tail mechanism. However, while a staggered injection outperforms a single stage injection also in cases with radioactive runaway electron sources, no cases with acceptable runaway electron currents are found for a {DT}-plasma with a 15 {MA} plasma current.},

The initial velocity component of the injected pellet is maintained during ablation in a hot plasma, and the pellet penetrates to the core plasma. On the other hand, it has been observed that part of high density pellet plasmoid, which is formed around the pellet substance by ablating hydrogen pellet, intermittently breaks away from the pellet ablating position and the breakaway plasmoid is transported across a confinement field. The breakaway plasmoid recurrently develops at the rate of about 100 times per millisecond and it is non-diffusively transported approximately 0.1 m during its several 10 µs lifetime in the opposite direction to the pellet motion, namely, toward the low magnetic field side. This observation gives a reasonable explanation for the difference between the pellet ablation position and the effective particle deposition profile.},

It has been observed that the pellet trajectory deviates from its injection direction, toroidally and vertically depending on the direction of the tangentially applied neutral beams. The magnitude of the toroidal deviation is similar in the clockwise as well as counter-clockwise neutral beam directions and is of 15–20 cm with a deflection speed of up to 400 m s−1. In contrast, an asymmetry in trajectory deflection has been observed in the vertical direction. Experimental results also indicate that the starting radius of the pellet trajectory bending in the counter-clockwise neutral beam case is more inward to that of the plasma. Collectively this leads to less penetration of the pellet inside the plasma and is prominent in the case of the clockwise neutral beam. Additionally, this fact supports evidence that the fast ion plays an important role in the pellet ablation process in the Large Helical Device. The pellet deflection is explained by the rocket effect due to unilateral ablation by the fast ions. The possible cause of the difference in the vertical deflection is explained by considering the geometrical aspects of the magnetic field structure.},

Abstract:
Fusion power is a proposed form of power generation that would use the heat from nuclear fusion reactions to generate electricity. The leading candidate for a practical fusion reactor is a device called a tokamak, a device which uses a powerful magnetic field to confine plasma in the shape of a torus. {ITER} (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) is a large international program that will bring together 35 countries to construct the world's largest tokamak in the south of France. Effective and reliable disruption (plasma instabilities) mitigation is critical for {ITER} and future tokamak reactors to avoid dam- ages due to extreme localized heating, deposition of high-energy relativistic electrons, and large electromechanical forces. The U.S. is the lead international partner in the development of a Disruption Mitigation System ({DMS}) for {ITER}. The most likely candidate for this {DMS} is the shattered pellet injection ({SPI}) which consists of injecting a plume of neon-deuterium fragments into the plasma thus bringing about a thermal quench. A 3D numerical model for the ablation of pellets and {SPI} fragments in tokamaks in the plasma disruption mitigation and fueling parameter space has been developed based on the Lagrangian particle method. The Lagrangian Particle pellet code implements the low magnetic Reynolds number {MHD} equations, kinetic models for the electronic heating, a pellet surface ablation model, an equation of state that supports multiple ionization states, radiation, and a model for grad-B drift of the ablated material across the magnetic eld. 3D simulations were performed to predict processes in the ablation cloud, the cloud shielding length, and pellet ablation rates. They also address the sensitivity of the pellet ablation processes to the various physics models, in particular the {MHD} forces and grad-B drift. These results are in good agreement with theory for spherically symmetric ablation ows and axisymmetric simulations of neon and deuterium pellets in increasing magnetic elds using the {FronTier} code. Finally, a detailed study of the influence of 3D effects, in particular grad-B drift, on pellet ablation rates and properties of ablation clouds is presented.},

Based on a series of course notes from graduate courses in plasma physics and fusion energy at {MIT}, the text begins with an overview of world energy needs, current methods of energy generation, and the potential role that fusion may play in the future. It covers energy issues such as the production of fusion power, power balance, the design of a simple fusion reactor and the basic plasma physics issues faced by the developers of fusion power. This book is suitable for graduate students and researchers working in applied physics and nuclear engineering. A large number of problems accumulated over two decades of teaching are included to aid understanding.},

We describe how the visual system can quickly extract broad statistics from a display, whereas poorly designed displays can lead to misperceptions and illusions. Extracting global statistics is fast, but comparing between subsets of values is slow. Effective graphics avoid taxing working memory, guide attention, and respect familiar conventions.

It is found that even if one takes into account the optical thickness for radiation, the energy loss due to line radiation associated with neon is strong enough to limit the temperature and the pressure of the ionized plasmoid for pure neon or hydrogen–neon mixed pellets in the early phase of the material homogenization. Consequently, the ionized plasmoid of the neon mixed pellets is expected to homogenize along the magnetic field line where the ablated material is released—without significantly making the cross-field drift motion—as compared to pure hydrogen pellets.},

	abstract = {Enhanced confinement is observed in neutral beam injector ({NBI})-heated hydrogen discharges made in the stellarator {TJ}-{II} after the injection of a single cryogenic fuel pellet into the plasma core. In addition to the expected increase in electron density, ne, in the core after pellet injection ({PI}), the plasma diamagnetic energy content is seen to rise, with respect to similar discharges without {PI}, by up to 40\%. Furthermore, the energy confinement time, τEdiag, as determined using a diamagnetic loop, is enhanced when compared to predictions obtained using the International Stellarator Scaling law [H. Yamada et al., Nucl. Fusion 45, 1684 (2005)] and the triple product, ne · Ti · τEdiag, exhibits a clear bifurcation point toward an improved confinement branch as compared to the branch product predicted by this scaling law. In general, once such a pellet-induced enhanced confinement ({PiEC}) phase has been established, it is characterized by steepened radial density gradients, by more negative plasma potential in the core, more negative radial electric fields, Er, across a broad plasma region, as well as by reductions in density and plasma potential fluctuations in the density gradient region. In addition, experimental observations show increased peaking of core radiation losses, this pointing to edge/core plasma decoupling. In parallel, neoclassical simulations of reference and {PiEC} plasmas predict increased particle and energy confinement times during a {PiEC} phase together with a more negative Er profile. Qualitative rather than quantitative agreement with experimental parameters is found, indicating that turbulence seems to play a significant role here. In summary, single cryogenic pellet injection facilitates the achievement of an enhanced operational regime that was previously not observed in {NBI}-heated discharges of the {TJ}-{II}.},

	abstract = {A kinetic model is developed to determine the power deposition from energetic electrons into the neutral gas shield of an ablating high-Z pellet. For high-Z, the velocity distribution of the hot electrons is nearly isotropic, and we use this feature to develop solutions to the kinetic equation. In contrast to pre-existing models, we consider the effect of gyro-motion as well as elastic scattering of the hot electrons. Two limits are considered: when the gyro-frequency is much greater than the elastic collision frequency, the hot electrons diffuse longitudinally along the field lines as they slow down; but if the gyro-frequency is much less than the elastic collision frequency, the hot electrons diffuse radially. In both limits, it is possible to express the kinetic equation describing the hot electrons independently of the gas density profile, and therefore, the power deposition model is universal in this respect. The emphasis on elastic scattering yields an ablation rate which scales as Z−7/6 which is different than Z−2/3 shown in Sergeev et al (2006 Plasma Phys. Rep. 32 5). It is also shown that the sheath potential required to maintain ambipolarity in the cloud scales as Z−1/3. Fluid simulations yield ablation rates that scale with the four-thirds power of the pellet radius in agreement with [2].},

The reason for pellet acceleration is believed to originate from drift effects: the ionised part of pellet cloud is affected by the grad-B drift, therefore, the cloud becomes polarised. The E × B drift then deforms the pellet cloud so that it can no longer follow the original flux bundle - this results in a less efficient shielding on the pellet's {HFS} region, where the subsequently enhanced ablation pushes the pellet towards {LFS}, like a rocket. In order to study this effect, a simple and a comprehensive ablation model was developed.

	abstract = {A proof-of-principle device for characterizing electron-beam rocket pellet acceleration has been developed and operated during the last few years. Experimental data have been collected for thousands of accelerated hydrogen pellets under a variety of beam conditions. One intact hydrogen pellet was accelerated to a speed of 578 m/s by an electron beam of 10 {kV}, 0.8 A, and 1 ms. The collected data reveal the significant finding that the measured burn velocity of bare hydrogen pellets increases with the square of the beam voltage in a way that is qualitatively consistent with the theoretical prediction based on the neutral gas shielding ({NGS}) model. The measured burn velocity increases with the beam current or power and then saturates at values two to three times greater than that predicted by the {NGS} model. The discrepancy may result from low pellet strength and large beam-pellet interaction areas. Moreover, this feature may be the cause of the low measured exhaust velocity, which often exceeds the sonic velocity of the ablated gas. Consistent with the {NGS} model, the measured exhaust velocity increases in direct proportion to the beam current and in inverse proportion to the beam voltage. To alleviate the pellet strength problem, experiments have been performed with the hydrogen ice contained in a lightweight rocket casing or shell. Pellets in such sabots have the potential to withstand higher beam powers and achieve higher thrust-coupling efficiency. Some experimental results are reported and ways of accelerating pellets to higher velocity are discussed.},

	abstract = {During pellet injection in tokamaks, a rapid movement of pellet ablation substance towards the low-field or outward major radius R direction is observed, favoring pellet injection from the high-field side in order to promote deeper fuel penetration. The motion has been attributed to a vertical curvature and ∇B drift current induced inside the ionized ablated material by the 1/R toroidal field variation. The uncompensated vertical drift current inside the weakly diamagnetic (β\&lt;0.1) ablation cloud will cause charge separation at the boundary. The resulting electrostatic field induces the E×B drift to the large-R side of the torus. The calculated fuel penetration depth is consistent with inside launched pellet experiments on the {DIII}-D tokamak [J. L. Luxon and L. G. Davis, Fusion Technol. 8, 441 (1985)]. The dependence of the penetration depth with plasma parameters suggests that low velocity inside launched pellets may provide a unique solution to the refueling problem in larger and hotter machines of the future.},

	abstract = {A two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation code {CAP} has been developed in order to investigate the dynamics of hydrogenic pellet ablation in magnetized plasmas throughout their temporal evolution. One of the properties of the code is that it treats the solid-to-gas phase change at the pellet surface without imposing artificial boundary conditions there, as done in previous ablation models. The simulation includes multispecies atomic processes, mainly molecular dissociation and thermal ionization in the ablation flow beyond the pellet, with a kinetic heat flux model. It was found that ionization causes the formation of a quasistationary shock front in the supersonic region of the ablation flow, followed by a “second” sonic surface farther out. Anisotropic heating, due to the directionality of the magnetic field, contributes to a nonuniform ablation (recoil) pressure distribution over the pellet surface. Since the shear stress can exceed the yield strength of the solid for a sufficiently high heat flux, the solid pellet can be fluidized and flattened into a “pancake” shape while the pellet is ablating and losing mass. The effect of pellet deformation can shorten the pellet lifetime almost 3× from that assuming the pellet remains rigid and stationary during ablation.},

	abstract = {During the last 10 to 15 years, significant progress has been made worldwide in the area of pellet injection technology. This specialized field of research originated as a possible solution to the problem of depositing atoms of fuel deep within magnetically confined, hot plasmas for refueling of fusion power reactors. Using pellet injection systems, frozen macroscopic (millimeter-size) pellets composed of the isotopes of hydrogen are formed, accelerated, and transported to the plasma for fueling. The process and benefits of plasma fueling by this approach have been demonstrated conclusively on a number of toroidal magnetic confinement configurations; consequently, pellet injection is the leading technology for deep fueling of magnetically confined plasmas for controlled thermonuclear fusion research. Hydrogen pellet injection devices operate at very low temperatures (≂10 K) at which solid hydrogen ice can be formed and sustained. Most injectors use conventional pneumatic (light gas gun) or centrifuge (mechanical) acceleration concepts to inject hydrogen or deuterium pellets at speeds of ≂1–2 km/s. Pellet injectors that can operate at quasi-steady state (pellet delivery rates of 1–40 Hz) have been developed for long-pulse fueling. The design and operation of injectors with the heaviest hydrogen isotope, tritium, offer some special problems because of tritium’s radioactivity. To address these problems, a proof-of-principle experiment was carried out in which tritium pellets were formed and accelerated to speeds of 1.4 km/s. Tritium pellet injection is scheduled on major fusion research devices within the next few years. Several advanced accelerator concepts are under development to increase the pellet velocity. One of these is the two-stage light gas gun, for which speeds of slightly over 4 km/s have already been reported in laboratory experiments with deuterium ice. A few two-stage pneumatic systems (single-shot) have recently been installed on tokamak experiments. This article reviews the equipment and instruments that have been developed for pellet injection with emphasis on recent advances. Prospects for future development are addressed, as are possible applications of this technology to other areas of research.},

              A 3D numerical model for the ablation of pellets and shattered pellet injection fragments in tokamaks in the plasma disruption mitigation and fueling parameter space has been developed based on the Lagrangian particle ({LP}) method Samulyak

The pellet code implements the low magnetic Reynolds number {MHD} equations, kinetic models for the electronic heating, a pellet surface ablation model, an equation of state that supports multiple ionization states, radiation, and a model for grad-B drift of the ablated material across the magnetic field. The {LP} algorithm is highly adaptive, capable of simulating a large number of fragments in 3D while eliminating numerical difficulties of dealing with the tokamak background plasma. The code has achieved good agreement with theory for spherically symmetric ablation flows. Axisymmetric simulations of neon and deuterium pellets in magnetic fields ranging from 1 to 6 Tesla have been compared with previous simulations using the {FronTier} code, and very good agreement has also been obtained. The main physics contribution of the paper is a detailed study of the influence of 3D effects, in particular grad-B drift, on pellet ablation rates and properties of ablation clouds. Smaller reductions of ablation rates in magnetic fields compared to axially symmetric simulations have been demonstrated because the ablated material is not confined to narrowing channels in the presence of grad-B drift. Contribution of various factors in the grad-B drift model has also been quantified.},

The main features of the model are the explicit tracking of interfaces that separate the solid pellet from the ablated gas and the cold, dense and weakly ionized ablation cloud from the highly conducting fusion plasma, a surface ablation model, a kinetic model for the electron heat flux and an equation of state accounting for atomic processes in the ablation cloud. The interaction of the pellet ablation flow with the magnetic field including the J × B Lorentz force is studied here systematically for the first time. The model has also been validated through the comparison with the semi-analytic Transonic Flow model and previous purely hydrodynamic simulations. Contrary to prevailing expectations, the ablation rate is reduced only slightly when the geometry is changed from spherically symmetric to axially symmetric, in the case of purely hydrodynamic models. However, in the magnetohydrodynamic simulations the J × B force funnels the flow into an extended plasma shield, which intercepts the incident plasma heat flux and reduces the ablation rate, depending on the rise time of heat flux seen by the pellet. Shorter ‘warm-up’ times lead to narrower ablation channels, stronger shielding and reduced ablation rates. This new feature implies that pellets traversing strong plasma gradients, as in the edge pedestal region of the {ITER} plasma, could have significantly lower ablation rates if injected at higher velocity.},

            Understanding pellet ablation physics is crucial to realizing efficient fueling into a high temperature plasma for the steady state operation of {ITER} and future fusion reactors. Here we report the first observation of the formation of fluctuation structures in the pellet plasmoid during the pellet ablation process by a fast camera in a medium-sized fusion device, Heliotron J. The fluctuation has a normalized fluctuation level of {\textasciitilde} 15\% and propagates around the moving pellet across the magnetic field. By comparing the fluctuation structures with the shape of magnetic field lines calculated with the field line tracing code, we successfully reconstruct the spatio-temporal structure of the fluctuations during the pellet ablation process. The fluctuations are located at the locations displaced toroidally from the pellet and propagate in the cross-field direction around the pellet axis along the field line, indicating a three-dimensional behavior and structure of fluctuations. The fluctuation would be driven by a strong inhomogeneity formed around the pellet and invoke the relaxation of the gradient through a cross-field transport induced by the fluctuations, which could affect the pellet ablation and pellet fueling processes. Such fluctuations can be ubiquitously present at the inhomogeneity formed around a pellet in the pellet ablation process in fusion devices.},

Fusion 47, 103 (2007)] is used to simulate the ablation rate of refueling pellets, including the novel effect of electrostatically induced E×B rotation of the ablation cloud about its symmetry axis parallel to the magnetic field. The key finding is that the centrifugal force of cloud rotation pushes the cloud density radially outwards, creating a more “transparent” ablation channel. With reduced shielding, the steady state ablation rate of a deuterium pellet significantly increases from ∼35\% to 100\%, depending on the B-field strength. This new effect brings the ablation rate into better accord with a known theoretical scaling law, which agrees with most current experiments.},

	abstract = {It is shown that the ablation of a solid hydrogen pellet subject to a plasma is likely to produce a quasi-steady dense neutral gas cloud. The total integrated density of the cloud is such that the plasma electrons lose essentially all their energy in the cloud. The electron energy flux is degraded by inelastic collisions and elastic backscattering with the neutral molecules, providing local heating and acceleration of the neutral gas. Only a small fraction of the energy flux reaches the surface of the pellet, raising the pellet's surface temperature to a point where the energy flux at the pellet's surface is in balance with the energy lost through vaporization. The vaporization rate, in turn, determines the total integrated neutral gas cloud density. The scaling laws derived from the model indicate that the pellet lifetime varies as: where τp is the lifetime of the pellet and Te, ne, and rp0 are the electron temperature, density of the plasma, and initial pellet radius, respectively. A good agreement is found between this model and the {ORMAK} pellet injection experiment.},

	abstract = {Pellet injection is an effective tool for modifying the density profile in fusion devices, and can be used for both fuelling and plasma control. It has been employed successfully to mitigate transient events in tokamaks, e.g. disruptions. The use of pellets to control such events is also planned for {ITER}. In order to assess the performance of pellet injection schemes for future fusion devices, such as {ITER}, it is important that accurate estimates of the modified density profile created by the pellets are included in the modelling tools used to simulate such events. This can only be achieved through an understanding of the underlying physics of the mass deposition after pellet injection. Estimating the material deposition profile of a pellet is strongly affected by the pellet's trajectory and changing velocity. When a pellet is injected into a hot, magnetically confined plasma, it travels through the plasma in solid form while the outer layers are continuously ablated by the energy flux from the hot background plasma, resulting in material being deposited along the pellet trajectory. The cloud of ablated material initially has a cold dense structure-a plasmoid-which drifts towards the low-field side of the torus. This is caused by the charge separation that takes place due to electron and ion drifts in the inhomogeneous magnetic field, leading to the build-up of a vertical electric field, and the resulting E × B-drift moves the ablated material across magnetic field lines, where E and B denote the electric and magnetic field, respectively. This drift creates asymmetry and non-uniform heating of the ablation cloud. The asymmetry results in a less efficient shielding on the pellet's high field side region, where the enhanced ablation pushes the pellet towards the low field side, like a rocket. The rocket effect may strongly influence trajectories and penetration of pellets in fusion plasmas. Rocket model The aim of this project is to develop a semi-analytical model to study this effect and estimate pellet rocket acceleration in fusion devices. The rocket effect is driven by the difference in the cloud pressure on the low field side and high field side of the pellet. Simpler estimates to explain existing observations in medium-sized tokamaks exist, see e.g. [1, 2], but they are not widely used in the community. Only recently it has become apparent that this effect can be significant in future tokamaks with higher temperatures. The questions we would like to know the answer to are:  What is the order of magnitude of the acceleration from the rocket effect?  How does that depend on the pellet size, composition and background plasma parameters?  Is this effect in agreement with the observed acceleration in existing tokamaks (within reasonable margins)?  Is this effect strong enough to influence disruption mitigation plans for {ITER}?  Can we derive a self-contained model for the rocket-acceleration that can be implemented in simulation tools?
