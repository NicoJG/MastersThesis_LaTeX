> Where do I start?

The readme by David Frisk provides an overview over how this template is structured.

The sections or chapters in the template are only suggestions or for demonstration purposes, and you should form chapters that suit your report.

There are two flags that can be changed in settings.tex which affect the appearance of the cover pages.
"\ThesisType": changes the color of details on the cover pages that signifies whether this is a master's thesis or a bachelor thesis/degree project report. This does not affect any text in the template, so you'll need to update any text manually if you switch this flag from its orignal value.
"\InstitutionLocation": Determines whether to use the logo for Chalmers or the combined logo for Chalmers and GU. If set to chalmers and GU, it will also add in text referring to GU in a few spots. If your work is on a shared department such as CSE, you should change this flag to show both Chalmers and GU.
